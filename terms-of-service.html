        <p class="indent">1.1 The contents of this agreement include the agreement text, various rules that have been published or may be published/updated by the platform. All rules are integral parts of this agreement and have the same legal effect as the agreement text.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, your use of the auto-renewal service is subject to this agreement.</p>

        <p class="indent">1.2 If this agreement and related service terms need to be revised due to business development needs, the platform will announce it on the official platform. You can view the latest version of the terms. If you do not accept the modified terms after the platform modifies the above terms, you can choose to terminate the auto-renewal service. Your continued use of this service will be deemed as acceptance of the modified agreement.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Article 2: Service Description</div>

        <p class="indent">2.1 Upon activation of this service, you authorize the platform to commission Apple (referred to as "Apple," meaning Apple Inc. and its affiliates in this agreement) payment channel to deduct fees for the next billing cycle (including: 1 month, 3 months, 1 year) from your Apple ID linked to your FlareMate account when your paid VIP membership is about to expire.</p>

        <p class="indent">2.2 Auto-renewal: The platform commissions the Apple payment channel to collect fees for the next billing cycle of paid VIP (including: 1 month, 3 months, 1 year) through the account described in Article 2.1, record the payment in the paid VIP payment record, and correspondingly extend the paid VIP validity period. You need to ensure successful payment deduction from the above account through the Apple payment channel. You shall bear the responsibility for renewal failure due to insufficient deductible balance in the above account (including but not limited to paid VIP service termination, inability to participate in paid VIP activities, etc.).</p>

        <p class="indent">2.3 By choosing the Apple payment channel to enjoy this service, you are deemed to agree to Apple payment channel's payment instructions and agree that the Apple payment channel can deduct fees for the next billing cycle (including: 1 month, 3 months, 1 year) from the above account without verifying your account password, payment password, SMS verification code, or other information.</p>

        <p class="indent">3.2 If errors occur during the payment process, the platform and you should closely cooperate to investigate the cause, with each party bearing the losses caused by their own faults; if losses are caused by unequal faults of both parties, both parties shall bear corresponding responsibilities according to the degree of fault; if both parties share responsibility, the responsibility shall be shared equally.</p>

        <p class="indent">3.3 After you choose to use this service, unless you choose to terminate it, your automatic payment authorization to the platform is irrevocable, and the platform will not refund the fees deducted based on the payment method you chose when activating the auto-renewal service in any way.</p>

        <p class="indent">3.6 The service provided by the platform to you is limited to your use on the platform.
